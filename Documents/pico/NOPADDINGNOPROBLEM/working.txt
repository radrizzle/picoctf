NOPADDINGNOPROBLEM:
	Oracles can be your best friend, they will decrypt anything, except the flag's ciphertext. How will you break it? Connect with nc mercury.picoctf.net 28517.

		   "Welcome to the Padding Oracle Challenge
			This oracle will take anything you give it and decrypt using RSA. It will not accept the ciphertext with the secret message... Good Luck!

			Give me ciphertext to decrypt:"


So initially what I am thinking is that we are able to give the program plaintext, and get the resulting ciphertext, e is also relatively small which might mean if we have enough knowledge of plaintext -> ciphertext conversions we might be able to decrypt the secret message.

Looked at the hint just for good measure: What can you do with a different pair of ciphertext and plaintext? What if it is not so different after all...
Looking at the hint confirms what I am thinking. Ontop of this it occurred to me after a bit of research that the title hints that there may be no padding used to encrypt the secret message.
